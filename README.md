Solutions for the problems faced in spotify and some new suggestions for it 

THERE ARE CERTAIN PROBLEMS WHICH I HAVE FACED WHILE USING SPOTIFY , ONE IS THE ABSENCE  
OF THEMES IN SPOTIFY AS ONLY DARK MODE IS AVAILABLE. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THE 
FEATURE IN WHICH ONLY SONGS ADDED TO CERTAIN PLAYLIST CAN BE DOWNLOADED , WHERE I
THINK INDIVIDUAL SONGS SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO DOWNLOAD AND A PLAYLIST FOR THE 
DOWNLOADED SONGS MUST BE PRESENT WHERE OTHER SUB PLAYLISTS CAN BE PRESENT ALSO 
I BELIEVE THAT STATS FOR SPOTIFY AS A FEATURE MUST BE ADDED THAT GIVES US THE 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE LISTENING TIME OF VARIOUS ARTISTS AND GENRES MUST BE PRESENT
AND THAT LISTEN TIME CAN ALSO GIVE FY COINS , A NEW 
SUGGESTION , THE COLLECTION OF FY COINS WILL GIVE ACCESS TO FEATURES OF 
SPOTIFY PREMIUM TEMPORARILY SO THAT AFTER EXPERIENCING THE TEMPORARY FEEL OF 
SPOTIFY PREMIUM THAT IS WITHOUT ADS AND IMPROVED SOUND QUALITY WILL INCREASE THE 
CHANCES OF PEOPLE BUYING SPOTIFY PREMIUM LEADING TO INCREASED REVENUE OF THE 
COMPANY, ALSO I BELIEVE A KARAOKE MODE IN SPOTIFY WOULD BE A BOOST.
